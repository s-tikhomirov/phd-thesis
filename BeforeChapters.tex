This thesis explores various questions related to security and privacy of blockchain systems.

Bitcoin~\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} has allowed for the first time to transfer digital units of value without any trusted party.
Alternative cryptocurrencies inspired by Bitcoin aim at better addressing the issues of privacy, scalability, and feature set.
In particular, Ethereum introduces smart contracts in a Turing complete language and a stateful virtual machine, greatly expanding the design space of blockchain application, but expanding the attack surface as well.

In Part~\ref{Part1Privacy}, we discuss the networking layer of Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies.
We introduce an attack on privacy that allows an adversary to correlated transactions issued by the same user.
We test this technique on Bitcoin, as well as on the major privacy focused cryptocurrency.
We provide a separate overview of privacy-related functionality in mobile wallets.

Part~\ref{Part2Lightning} is dedicated to a promising approach at scaling blockchain, namely, off-chain protocols.
We study the Bitcoin's Lightning Network as the most prominent example of this approach.
We measure the potential effects of certain subset of Lightning nodes on privacy of the users.
Finally, we introduce a probing attack that lets an adversary reveal intermediary balances of payment channels it is not a part of -- the information supposed to be private.

Part~\ref{Part3Ethereum} explores Ethereum.
Ethereum's expressive language, Solidity, provides lots of opportunities for developers to write insecure code.
We propose a simpler language based on Solidity, called Findel, to encode financial agreements in a more declarative fashion.
We study the vulnerabilities in real-world Ethereum contracts and present a tool that automates bug detection in Solidity using static analysis.
Finally, we describe a proposal to limit the privacy-damaging effects of existing legal requirements (know-your-customer, or KYC) if a financial service is implemented on top of Ethereum.
