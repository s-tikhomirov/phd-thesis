\section{SmartCheck architecture}

The two major approaches to code analysis are \textit{dynamic} analysis and \textit{static} analysis~\cite{Liu2012}.
Dynamic analysis runs the program, while static analysis considers the program code without running it.
Static analysis usually includes three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item building an intermediate representation (IR), such as abstract syntax tree or three-address code, for a deeper analysis, compared to analyzing text;
	\item enriching the IR with more information~\cite{Woegerer2005} using algorithms such as control- and dataflow analysis (synonym, constant, and type propagation~\cite{Aho1986}), taint analysis~\cite{Tripp2009}, symbolic execution, abstract interpretation;
	\item vulnerability detection w.r.t.~a database of patterns that define vulnerability criteria in IR terms.
\end{enumerate}
This work does not consider formal verification methods, as they require a rarely available formal specification of the contract's intended functionality.

SmartCheck is a static analysis tool implemented in Java.
It runs lexical and syntactical analysis on the Solidity source code.
It uses ANTLR~\cite{Parr} and a custom Solidity grammar to generate an XML parse tree~\cite{Aho1986} as an intermediate representation (IR).
The tool detects vulnerabilities by using XPath~\cite{Liu2009} queries on the IR\@.
Thus, SmartCheck provides full coverage: the analyzed code is fully translated to the IR, and all its elements can be reached with XPath matching.
Line numbers are stored as XML attributes and help localize findings in the source code.
IR attributes can be enriched with more information, as new analysis methods are implemented.
The tool can be extended to support other smart contact languages by adding the corresponding ANTLR grammar and a pattern database.
The IR-level algorithms remain unchanged.

As an example, consider the Balance equality issue~(\ref{SolidityBalanceEquality}).
We aim to detect constructions that test the contract balance for equality, for instance:

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity]
if (this.balance == 42 ether){...}.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The parse tree of this construction is shown in Figure~\ref{ParseTree}, and the corresponding XPath pattern is shown in Listing~\ref{XPathListing}.

\begin{figure}
	\Tree [.ifStatement 
		{\texttt{if}}
		[.ifCondition
			[.expression 
				[.expression [.envVarDef {\texttt{this.balance}} ] ]
				{\texttt{==}}
				[.expression [.moneyExpr [.primaryExpr [.numberLiteral {\texttt{42}} ] ] {\texttt{ether}} ] ]
			]
		]
		[.block { \{ } {\ldots} { \} } ]
	]
	\caption{Parse tree for the Balance equality code example.}
	\label{ParseTree}
 \end{figure}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth} % https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/73305/142924
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={XPath pattern for the Balance equality issue.},label={XPathListing},language=XML]
//expression[expression//envVarDef
[matches(text()[1],"^this.balance$")]]
[matches(text()[1],"^==|!=$")]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

In this case, we do not expect false positives, as we can precisely describe the target construction in XPath.\footnote{Assuming that ANTLR builds the AST correctly based on the Solidity grammar.}
More complex rules can not be precisely described with XPath, which leads to false positives.
Consider the Re-entrancy issue~(\ref{SolidityReentrancyExternalCall}).
SmartCheck reports violations of the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, which do not always lead to re-entrancy (Listing~\ref{ReentrancyListing}).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Violation of CEI not leading to re-entrancy.},label={ReentrancyListing},language=Solidity]
pragma solidity 0.4.19;
contract Foo {
	bool inBar = false;
	function bar(address someAddress) {
		if (inBar) throw;
		inBar = true;
		someAddress.transfer(0);
		inBar = false;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
