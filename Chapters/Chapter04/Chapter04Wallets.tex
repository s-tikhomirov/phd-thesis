\chapter{Privacy of cryptocurrency wallets}

\label{Chapter04Wallets}

Smartphones have become the primary computing device for many millions of people and play an increasingly important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
In this Chapter, we study the privacy of mobile cryptocurrency wallets for Android -- the most prevalent mobile operating system.\footnote{This Chapter is based on~\cite{Biryukov2019}.}
We systematize the privacy-related characteristics of popular wallets and study $23$~selected wallets in more detail.
We compare their privacy-related properties and analyze their source code, both manually and using static analysis tools.
Our results show that most mobile wallets do not follow privacy guidelines.
Privacy-conscious users are quite limited in choosing a mobile wallet for Bitcoin, and even more so -- for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.


\section{Minimal privacy criteria} \label{section:Ch04Initialprivacycriteria}

We argue that the following privacy criteria are minimally necessary for a mobile wallet:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item No registration required. Otherwise, the wallet provider can link together and deanonymize user's transactions.
	\item Open-sourced code. A malicious closed-source application can track users or steal their funds. Open-sourced code decreases the risk of backdoors or other unintended functionality.
	\item Private keys generated and stored locally. Otherwise, the server that stores the keys requires full trust.
	\item Direct connection to the P2P network. The wallet should query blockchain data and broadcast transactions to peers directly and not through a server. Otherwise, the server can deanonymize and censor transactions.
\end{enumerate}
We check the first criterion by attempting to generate a receiving address in the wallet without registering or providing any personal information.
If we succeed, we proceed to check the next criteria.
We consider the second criterion met if we find a publicly available code repository with a fully-fledged Android application that the wallet's official website links to.\footnote{Strictly speaking, \textit{reproducible builds} are required to assure that the file in the Play~Store is not modified compared to the repository. We do not check for build reproducibility in this work.}
We check the third and the fourth criteria based on the official documentation and the source code.

We compile a list of wallets recommended on the official websites of the considered cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Dash, Monero, and Zcash.
We also consider the most popular wallets (based on the publicly available approximate number of Play~Store downloads).
The following wallets satisfy these criteria (Bitcoin unless specified): Bitcoin wallet, Bither, BRD, Dash wallet (Dash), Electrum,\footnote{Electrum is originally a desktop application; the official GitHub repository gives instructions on how to generate an APK file using Kivy GUI\@. Electrum wallet relies on an independent network of nodes (Electrum servers) to receive blockchain data and broadcast transactions. Though Electrum servers are not genuine cryptocurrency P2P nodes, we consider Electrum satisfy the P2P criteria, as a user can technically choose which Electrum servers to connect to, including their own trusted server.} Monerujo (Monero), Simple Bitcoin (marked in bold in Table~\ref{tab:minimal-criteria}).
No multi-currency wallets and no Zcash wallets satisfy these criteria.

\section{Analysis of selected wallets} \label{section:Ch04Analysis}

The following wallets have passed the minimal privacy criteria: Bitcoin Wallet, Bither, BRD, Dash~Wallet, Electrum, Monerujo, and Simple~Bitcoin.
% Samourai, despite English spelling being "Samurai"
We add the Samourai wallet to our list due to its heavy emphasis on privacy.\footnote{Strictly speaking, Samourai did not pass our initial test: it connects to a remote node via RPC, not P2P, and requires full control over it~\cite{SamouraiRPC}. We mark it with “+*” in Table~\ref{tab:minimal-criteria}.}
We now study these wallets in more detail.


\subsection{Manual inspection}

\paragraph{Independent installation}
Users usually install Android applications from the Play Store, which requires a Google account.
A privacy-conscious user may want to avoid linking their cryptocurrency activity with their Google profile.
They may use \mbox{F-Droid} (an independent application store for free and open-source applications~\cite{FDroid}) or install the application manually from an APK file.
Out of the seven~wallets we considered, three are available in F-Droid, and five~can be installed from an APK file (see Table~\ref{tab:installation}).

\begin{table*}

\end{table*}

\paragraph{Permissions}
Android \textit{permissions} restrict access to sensitive user information and device functionality.
Application developers declare the necessary permissions in the application's \textit{manifest file}.
The user grants permissions at installation time or runtime.\footnote{Starting from Android~6.0.}
Permissions that give access to critical functionality or personal information are referred to as \textit{dangerous}~\cite{Android}.

Wallets vary in the number and importance of permissions they require (Table~\ref{tab:permissions}, dangerous permissions in bold).
Airbitz requires the highest number of permissions ($15$).
Two applications require access to coarse and fine location (Airbitz, BRD) and sending SMS (BRD, Samourai).
Electrum requests the lowest number of permissions -- four (three of them dangerous).
All wallets require at least one dangerous permission -- camera access, required to scan cryptocurrency addresses presented as QR~codes.

\end{table*}


\paragraph{Privacy policies}
Google~Play~store rules prescribe all Android applications that handle "personal or sensitive user data" to declare a privacy policy.
We compare the privacy policies of the selected wallets (Table~\ref{tab:privacy-policies}).

Privacy policies of some wallets (Bitcoin wallet~\cite{BitcoinWalletPrivacyPolicy}, Dash wallet~\cite{DashWalletPrivacyPolicy}, Bither~\cite{BitherWalletPrivacyPolicy}, Monerujo~\cite{MonerujoPrivacyPolicy}) are relatively concise and only justify the use of some of the required permissions.
Privacy policies of BRD~\cite{BRDPrivacyPolicy} and Electrum~\cite{ElectrumPrivacyPolicy} are more elaborate.
Bither privacy policy provides the rationale behind requiring permission to record audio: it allows for "collecting ambience entropy for XRandom."
BRD uses cookies, trackers, and third-party providers for analytics: Google Analytics and Firebase.
These tools allow wallet developers to analyze crash reports and collect application usage patterns.
Such data may be used to link users' activity with unique identifiers of their devices.
Simple Bitcoin has no privacy policy.
The link from Google Play refers to the wallet's official website~\cite{SimpleBitcoin}, which does not specify whether the application collects, stores, or transmits the users' data.
Monerujo privacy policy notes that the application uses the exchange rates from the public API of \url{kraken.com}, and an exchange service \url{xmr.to}, which are subjects to their privacy policies (marked with (+) in Table~\ref{tab:privacy-policies}).
Mycelium transmits a report to the developers' server in case of a crash.
The developers claim they "took care that it does not contain unnecessary privacy relevant information."
The Samourai wallet collects users' IP addresses "with replaced last byte," which can hardly be considered anonymization: one may still infer the approximate location from the first three bytes of the IP address (marked with "+*" in Table~\ref{tab:privacy-policies}).
Airbitz broadcasts transactions through Electrum servers; a user may choose a server.
In many cases, the link to the privacy policy from the wallet's Play~Store page leads to the privacy policy of the corresponding \textit{website}, not the \textit{wallet}.

	\end{tabular}
	%}
	\label{tab:privacy-policies}
\end{table*}


\paragraph{Networking}
All wallets with P2P transaction broadcasting except Monerujo use hard-coded DNS seeds to bootstrap.
Simple Bitcoin adds one random node from a hard-coded list to a list of peers obtained via bootstrapping.\footnote{\url{5.9.104.252}, \url{213.133.103.56}, \url{213.133.99.89}; all unreachable as of 2018.}
Electrum connects to two random servers from a hard-coded list of~$52$~servers.
It requests the transaction history from a single server and checks it against block headers sent by other servers.
Monerujo lets the user either choose from three hard-coded URLs that resolve to a list of publicly available nodes~\footnote{\url{node.moneroworld.com:18089}, \url{node.xmrbackb.one}, \url{node.xmr.be}} or provide the credentials for connecting to a custom node.

We tried to connect Bitcoin wallets with P2P broadcast to our own full node.
Bitcoin wallet and Simple~Bitcoin did connect,\footnote{Version strings: \texttt{/bitcoinj:0.14.7/Bitcoin Wallet:6.29/}, \texttt{/bitcoinj:0.14.4/Bitcoin:1.075/}.} BRD did not.
Bither did not provide this option.

Wallets with P2P networking have a \textit{network monitor} that displays the IP addresses of connected nodes.
BRD shows only the IP of the "primary node" (without specifying what it means).
Electrum shows the address of the server used to query the transaction history (other servers are used to check it).
Simple~Bitcoin only shows the number of connected peers.
The number of established connections varies from wallet to wallet.

The summary of the networking characteristics is presented in Table~\ref{tab:connectivity-issues}.

\end{table*}


\subsection{Static analysis}

We analyzed the source code of the selected wallets using two tools: FlowDroid and SmartDec Scanner.

\subsubsection*{FlowDroid}

FlowDroid~\cite{Arzt2014} is an open-source static analysis tool.\footnote{The source code is available at~\cite{FlowDroid}.}
It uses data flow analysis to detect execution paths that transfer data from \textit{sources} (functions that may return sensitive data) into \textit{sinks} (functions that send data elsewhere).
FlowDroid fails to scan Bitcoin wallet, Bither, and Monerujo (stopped after a 2~hour timeout).
Samourai has not been scanned because of the unavailability of the APK file.\footnote{The application was marked as "unreleased" in the Play~Store at the time of the experiment, which prevented us from obtaining the APK.}
FlowDroid detected potential data leaks in $8$~out of~$14$~applications (see Table~\ref{tab:static-analysis}).

\subsubsection*{SmartDec Scanner}
We scan the wallets with a proprietary static analysis tool SmartDec~Scanner~\cite{SmartDec2018}.
We manually inspect the results and summarize the most prevalent privacy-related issues, in a roughly decreasing order of potential threat.
Note that these issues do not directly lead to exploits.

\paragraph{Leak to external storage}
Android provides internal and external storage.\footnote{Historically, external storage was assumed to be on a removable memory card, which now may not be the case.}
An application can only access its own directory in the internal storage.
External storage is available to other applications.

Sensitive data should only be kept in internal storage.
Android automatically backs up data and settings of applications that did not opt out.\footnote{By setting \texttt{android:allowBackup="false"} in the Manifest file.}
Automatic backups should be disabled for privacy-critical applications.

\paragraph{XSS attacks via Javascript in WebView}
One method of developing dynamic user interfaces on Android is using JavaScript inside a \texttt{WebView} -- an Android component that displays web pages.
By default, execution of JavaScript code in \texttt{WebView} is disabled, but a developer can override this setting (\texttt{setJavaScriptEnabled(true)}).
Executing malicious JavaScript code may lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.\footnote{Even trusted code, e.g.,~from the application's resources, may contain unintended side effects or bugs, and implicitly leak information.}
We detect two instances of this issue in BRD (in \texttt{FragmentSupport} and \texttt{WebViewActivity} classes).
In both cases, the warning from Android Lint -- a static analyzer built into the standard Android development environment -- is suppressed.

\paragraph{Insecure connection}
In Java, the \texttt{X509TrustManager} class specifies the parameters of a TLS connection.
A developer can override its methods to accept all certificates.
Accepting certificates that are not authenticated by a chain of signatures up to a trusted root CA may lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.
Connections between Electrum servers, unlike the Bitcoin protocol, are encrypted and authenticated with TLS\@.
Bitcoin wallet and Dash wallet, in addition to their respective P2P protocols, use Electrum servers for querying the balance when sweeping a paper wallet.
Bither defines HTTP URLs of its own API (\url{bither.net}) and a block explorer \url{blockchain.info} (class \texttt{BitherUrl}), which can lead to displaying incorrect balances or fake transactions in case of a man-in-the-middle attack.
Simple Bitcoin uses five hard-coded URLs to query current fees.
One of them\footnote{\url{http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main}.} uses an unencrypted connection.
A man-in-the-middle attack of a fee estimator may lead to a denial of service attack (transactions with low fees may never be confirmed), though this scenario requires four other APIs served over HTTPS to fail simultaneously.

\paragraph{Leak into logs}
Each Android application can write to its log.
Applications can also read their logs with the \texttt{READ\_LOGS} permission.
Before Android~4.0, this permission also granted access to logs of other applications.

It is possible to access logs on a rooted device or using developer tools.
All wallets log details about their operation, including error messages, which may include sensitive data (e.g.,~the IP address of a trusted node).
This issue is present in all wallets, as all wallets use logging in exception handlers.
One may find all occurrences of this issue by searching for the methods of the \texttt{Log} class, \texttt{print}, \texttt{println}, and exception handlers with \texttt{ex.printStackTrace()}.
Further investigation is needed to determine the impact and probability of data leaks.

The summary of the results obtained with static analysis (both FlowDroid and SmartDec~Scanner) is presented in Table~\ref{tab:static-analysis}.

\section{Conclusion} \label{section:Ch04Conclusion}

We have studied Android wallets for Bitcoin and the major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.
Most wallets do not satisfy our minimal privacy criteria.
Many wallets obtain dangerous permissions and potentially leak users' private information.
Static analysis reveals defects in their source code.

Secure development practices are especially relevant for application targeting mobile devices, which store lots of personal data and can be easily lost or stolen.
Mobile developers should require as few permissions as possible, open-source the code, provide alternative installation methods (F-Droid, direct APK download), and implement other privacy-preserving measures to protect their users' privacy.
