\section{Conclusion and future work}
	
WWe have provided a comprehensive overview and classification of code issues in Solidity -- the primary high-level language for Ethereum smart contracts.
We have implemented SmartCheck -- an efficient static analysis tool for Solidity, which offers significant improvements over existing alternatives.
We tested our tool on a massive set of real-world contracts and detected code issues in most of them.
The tool can be enhanced in multiple ways: improving the grammar\footnote{The currently used grammar failed to parse $0.16\%$~of lines in our dataset.}, making patterns more precise (e.g.,~the temporarily muted {\usevalue SolidityUncheckedMath:name }), adding new patterns, implementing more sophisticated static analysis methods, adding support for other languages.

Security is still an issue in blockchain development.
We hope that SmartCheck will help solve this major challenge by providing smart contract developers with fast and relevant feedback on potentially problematic source code patterns.
